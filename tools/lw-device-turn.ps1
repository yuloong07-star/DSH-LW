# The turn runs under `run-as`, so it is the app's uid with the app's own dsh home: the phone's
# credentials and settings are the ones the model answers with, and the channel it calls is the one
# the app is serving. Two limits come with that, both explained in tools/lw-device/headless.sh: the
# session works in the sandbox rather than in shared storage, and its file tools cannot read even
# there, so this is for calls that act on the screen. Reading a screenshot back is verified in the
# app's own host, where the files are ordinary workspace paths
