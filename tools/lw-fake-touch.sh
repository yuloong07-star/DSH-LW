# Fake a real finger on the phone's own touchscreen, for testing the brake without a person
#
# Writing to an evdev node goes into the kernel's input core, so the events reach every reader of
# that node - Luwi's touch watch included - while an injected touch never appears there at
# all. That difference is exactly what the brake is built on, so this is the only way to exercise
# it from a machine
#
# The node and the raw ranges come from `lw_probe`: on 192.168.1.103 it is /dev/input/event7 ("fts")
# with x 0..10799 and y 0..23999, i.e. ten units per screen pixel. The coordinates below are raw
# device units, not screen pixels
#
# usage: su -c 'sh lw-fake-touch.sh down [rawX rawY]'   # a finger arrives and stays
#        su -c 'sh lw-fake-touch.sh up'                 # the finger leaves
#
# A finger left down is treated by the system as a real press: if the screen scrolls underneath it,
# letting go lands as a tap on whatever is there by then. Point it at something harmless
