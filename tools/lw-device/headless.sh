# Run one headless dsh turn on the device, as the app's uid, with the app's own home and tree
#
# usage: headless.sh "<task>" <channel-endpoint> <channel-token> [session-directory]
#
# The point of running it here rather than from the development machine is that everything the
# tools and the model touch is the device's own: the tree the APK shipped, the phone's own
# ~/.credentials.yaml and settings.yaml, and the privileged channel the app is serving. It is how a
# tool is proven to work when a model calls it, rather than when curl calls it
#
# Two limits come from `run-as` and they are easy to mistake for bugs:
# - it gives the app's uid but not the app's mount namespace, so `/storage/emulated/0` - the
#   workspace, which the app itself writes to - is out of reach. The session therefore works in a
#   directory inside the sandbox
# - a file inside an app-private path cannot be read by the file tools even so: something in the
#   read path opens the ancestors of the file, and `/data/user/0` is mode 0711, which the app uid may
#   traverse but not open. Calls that act on the screen are unaffected; reading a picture back has to
#   happen in the app's own host, whose workspace paths are ordinary shared storage
