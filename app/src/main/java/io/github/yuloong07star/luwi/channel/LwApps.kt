/**
 * The apps this device offers to start, and what each one is called
 *
 * A caller that has a name for an app - "设置", "哔哩哔哩" - has no way to turn it into the package a
 * launch needs, and the shell commands that would list them are refused this app's uid: `pm` without
 * a `--user` asks about every user at once and needs `INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL` to do it (measured:
 * `Permission Denial: runListPackages from pm command asks to run as user 999 but is calling from
 * uid u0a326`), and with an explicit `--user` the same command answers with this app alone, because
 * Android 11 hides every other package from an app that has not asked for it (measured: 148
 * third-party packages as root against 1 as this uid)
 *
 * So the list is asked for the way an app is meant to ask: `queryIntentActivities` on the launcher
 * intent, which is the same question the home screen asks. What makes the other apps visible is the
 * `<queries>` declaration in the manifest - the narrow one for that intent rather than
 * `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`, because "the things a person can start" is exactly what is wanted here, and
 * it is a declaration rather than a permission
 *
 * Two things this cannot answer, and both are why the privileged side stays in the loop: it only
 * sees the user this app runs as (a cloned app is a package in another user, and
 * [LwLaunch.packages] is what knows about those), and a package that no launcher icon points at is
 * not in the list at all
