 * Raw `getevent -p` output

 * The app cannot read `/dev/input` at all - the nodes are the `input` group's and SELinux refuses
 * the shell domain too - so this is only ever run from the privileged process. Both things that
 * need it live there: the probe that reports what the device has, and the touch watch, which needs
 * to know which node is the touchscreen before it reads one
 *
 * The output is returned as text rather than parsed here, because [InputDevices] is the one place
 * that decides what a device is, and it can be tested without a device
