/**
 * Hands the service binder to the app through the app's own ContentProvider
 *
 * Shizuku's user services are the obvious carrier and are exactly what this avoids: the route
 * here is a provider the app owns, whose reply bundle is how the app answers with a binder of its
 * own. That is the only direction the app can watch for the privileged process dying, and the
 * provider checks the caller's uid plus a one time token before it accepts anything, so exporting
 * it is not a way in for other apps
 *
 * The provider is reached through `IActivityManager.getContentProviderExternal`, not through
 * `ContentResolver`. That is not a preference: a process started by app_process has no
 * IApplicationThread, so AMS refuses it with "Unable to find app for caller ... when getting
 * content provider", while the external entry point exists for exactly this shape of caller. It
 * also means the call reaches the provider directly, so the provider still sees this process's
 * uid rather than the system's
 *
 * Everything hidden is reached reflectively rather than through hidden-API stubs, which keeps the
 * app compiling against the public SDK; a process started this way can reflect on the platform's
 * own classes, as the ActivityThread work above already relies on
