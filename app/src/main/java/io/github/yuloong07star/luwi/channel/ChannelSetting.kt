 * install shows nothing but tools failing, and nothing on the phone says which of root and Shizuku
 * is missing or where to allow it. Hence this: the state of the channel, what each route is still
 * waiting for, and one button that tries
 *
 * Everything that asks the system runs on a thread of its own. The first connection is where
 * KernelSU puts its prompt up, and Shizuku puts its own dialog up, so the try can take a minute -
 * which on a main thread is an ANR rather than a wait
