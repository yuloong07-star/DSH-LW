/**
 * The directory sessions work in, and the proof that the host can actually use it
 *
 * dsh works in real paths: its directory picker lists host filesystem paths and a session's `cwd`
 * is the workspace path. A storage-access-framework grant cannot serve that, because the grant
 * lives in this process's `ContentResolver` and the host is a Node child process with no way to
 * reach it - what makes shared storage writable *by path* is the all-files access appop. So the
 * shared workspace is used when the app holds that access, and the app's own media directory
 * otherwise, which needs no permission and is still visible to a file manager
 *
 * Every candidate is proven by a write before it is adopted, because the appop can be revoked
 * between runs, and a directory that lists is not necessarily one that accepts files
