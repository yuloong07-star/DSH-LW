 * screen's own, so everything above this - a finger on the preview, a tool call - only has to
 * scale its own box into the screen and never has to know how the screen is built
 *
 * A gesture is a sequence rather than one call, because the platform matches the moves to the
 * press that started them by their down time: the press is remembered here and reused until the
 * finger is lifted
 *
 * A drag can also be interrupted, by the one thing that outranks this process: the person holding
 * the phone. That is what [watch] is for, and it only ever applies to the phone's own screen,
 * because a screen of ours has nobody standing over it
