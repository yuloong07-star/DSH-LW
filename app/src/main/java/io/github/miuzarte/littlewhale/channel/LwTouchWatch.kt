 * the `input` group's, which the app is not in, while this process was started as root or shell
 * for exactly this kind of reading
 *
 * What makes the signal mean "a person" rather than "somebody touched the screen" is where
 * injection happens: `InputManager.injectInputEvent` enters the pipeline after the kernel's input
 * reader, so the model's own taps never appear on this node. That was measured before anything was
 * built on it, and every event read here is somebody's finger
 *
 * The node is read here rather than by running `getevent`: a child process writing lines into a
 * pipe buffers them, and a brake that hears about a finger a second late is not a brake. A read
 * blocked on an evdev node costs nothing until the glass is touched
 *
 * Nothing here decides when the phone counts as the user's - it reports what happened and each
 * caller picks its own window, because a drag being interrupted and a call being refused are two
 * different questions
