/**
 * The virtual screens the privileged process hosts
 *
 * They are built here rather than in the app for two reasons. The display flags that make one a
 * screen rather than a recording target are gated on CAPTURE_VIDEO_OUTPUT, which the app does not
 * hold; and what may later run on one - a launch, an injected tap, a capture - is decided against
 * the uid that created it, which is this process's
 *
 * The output surface belongs to the app and this class never touches its frames: the compositor
 * writes into that surface directly, so a preview needs no encoder, no socket and no native code
 * at all. Detaching is a first-class state, because the surface dies with the app's window while
 * the screen is meant to outlive it
 *
 * More than one screen can exist at a time, so every call names the one it means, and the name a
 * screen is created with has to be unique as well: it is the only thing that ties a screen to the
 * compositor's own id, which is what a screenshot is asked for by
