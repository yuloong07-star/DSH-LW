 * A picture of a screen

 * anybody is looking: the app's own options - copying the preview's surface - only exist while
 * that preview does, and a screen is meant to run with the app in the background
 *
 * `screencap -d` names a display the way the compositor does, by its physical id, and the only
 * thing that ties a screen of ours to that id is the name it was created with. The compositor's
 * list is therefore what the id is read out of, once per name. The phone's own screen needs none
 * of that: it is what `screencap` captures when it is told nothing, and the screenshot that
 * follows is a plain file the caller can read
