/**
 * The settings only a privileged uid may write
 *
 * The app cannot turn its own accessibility service on: that switch is a secure setting, and
 * writing one takes a permission this app does not hold and cannot ask for at runtime. Both uids
 * the channel can produce do hold it, so this is one more thing the privileged process is for -
 * and the reason the user never has to find the page in system settings that hides it
 *
 * The write goes through the `settings` command rather than through this process's own
 * ContentResolver, and that is not a shortcut. A process started by app_process has no
 * IApplicationThread, so asking for the settings provider from here is refused with "Unable to
 * find app for caller" - the same wall the app's own provider had to be reached around. The
 * command works because it reaches the provider the other way, through an external token
 *
 * Writing the setting is not quite the whole job: Android 13 lets an app that no store installed
 * hold its own accessibility service back, which is this app's case, and a component that is
 * already in the list but not bound does not come back from a write that changes nothing. Both of
 * those are handled here rather than left for the user to work out
