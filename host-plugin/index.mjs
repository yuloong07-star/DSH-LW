 * every single time is a pattern: a game that watches its own input can tell it apart from a
 * person, and a person never taps the same pixel twice
 *
 * The draw is confined to the middle of the rectangle - a fifth of the way in from each edge - so
 * it stays clear of the border and of whatever sits next to the row
